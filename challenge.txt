# Challenge In Progress
# 
# Your challenge is to implement the following memory game:
# 
# The computer makes 20 boxes, numbered 1 to 20. Into each box, it places a single letter randomly taken from the set of letters: "aabbccddeeffgghhiijj". The aim of the game is to remove all the boxes.
# 
# Each turn the user is told which boxes are still present. Initially this will be all 20.
# 
# The user then selects which box to open by its number, and the computer tells the user what letter is in that box. Once the user has seen what's in the box, the screen is cleared and the user may select another box to open.
# 
# If the user selects two boxes in a row that contain the same letter, those two boxes are removed.
# 
# The user can open 40 boxes before the game ends. If the user removes all the boxes before their 40 opens are up, they win. Otherwise, they lose.
# 
# If your program outputs to a console, imagine there is a method named clearScreen or clear_screen that clears the screen. Do not implement this method yourself.
# 
# We've given you a generous 2 hour time limit, but most people will finish the challenge in under 45 minutes. Please work continuously without interruptions or use of external resources.
# 
# Write your program in the box below. Stay on this page; do not consult references; do not run or otherwise test your code.
